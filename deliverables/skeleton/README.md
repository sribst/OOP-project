* Run the project

```
$ make run
```

* Run the test suite

```
$ make test
```

* Compile the project without running it

```
$ make all
```

* Clean the project

```
$ make clean
```

* Launch sbt

```
$ make default
```

This calls the interactive Scala Build Tool (a.k.a sbt).
This is equivalent to:

```
$ sbt
```

Once the sbt is running, you can compile the project with
the following command:

```
> compile
```

And run it:

```
> run
```

* Clean the project

Once the sbt is running, you can clean the project with
the following command:

```
> clean
```
